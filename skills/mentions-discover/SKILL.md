# mentions-discover

Focused query-discovery skill. Use only when the user **explicitly asks** what prompts or questions they should be tracking for a brand's AI visibility — the starting query set for a GEO/monitoring program.

## When to use this skill

**DO use when the user asks:**

- "What queries should I track for Linear?"
- "Which prompts should I monitor to measure my AI visibility?"
- "Give me the commercial-intent questions buyers ask in the project-management space"
- "What comparison queries mention my competitors?"

**Do NOT use when:**

- The user already has a specific query and wants to check it — use [`mentions-check`](https://github.com/nikhonit/llm-mentions-skills/tree/main/skills/mentions-check) instead
- A brand is mentioned in passing without a request to build a tracking set
- The user has not signaled they want query suggestions

This call costs $0.50. Confirm the brand (and industry, if known) before calling.

## Tools

### `discover_queries` — $0.50 per call

Return a ranked set of candidate queries to track for a brand, spanning informational, commercial, and comparison intents.

Arguments:

- `brand` *(required)* — the brand to generate tracking queries for, e.g. `"Linear"`
- `industry` — optional context to sharpen suggestions, e.g. `"project management software"`
- `count` — how many queries to return, 1–100 (default 50)

Example response:

```json
{
  "brand": "Linear",
  "queries": [
    { "query": "best project management tool for engineers", "intent": "commercial" },
    { "query": "Linear vs Jira",                              "intent": "comparison" },
    { "query": "what is Linear used for",                     "intent": "informational" }
  ],
  "cost_cents": 50,
  "balance_after_cents": 50
}
```

Feed the returned `query` strings into `mentions-check` (or `mentions-full`'s `check_mentions`) to measure visibility, or into `watch` to monitor them over time.

## Authentication

Set `MENTIONSAPI_KEY` to your MentionsAPI key (format `lvk_live_...`). Free key with $1 credit at <https://mentionsapi.com/signup> — no card.

## Pricing

**Pay-as-you-go. No subscriptions, no monthly tiers, credits never expire.** $1 free signup credit, $5 minimum top-up. `discover_queries` is $0.50 per call regardless of `count`. Failed calls are not billed.

## Errors

Every call returns a Python dict. On success it's the API response; on failure it has an `error` key (`auth_required`, `auth_invalid`, `insufficient_balance`, `rate_limit_exceeded`, `network`). See the [full skill](https://github.com/nikhonit/llm-mentions-skills/tree/main/skills/mentions-full) for the complete error contract.
